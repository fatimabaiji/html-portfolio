About Me

I’m currently working through a Udemy course to build a strong foundation in web development.

I’m learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, taking my first steps in becoming a front-end developer.

I’m eager to collaborate on small projects to sharpen my skills and gain real-world experience.

I’m excited to connect with other self-taught developers who know the unique challenges of learning independently.

Feel free to ask me about staying organized as a self-taught learner, overcoming obstacles, and staying motivated on a long learning journey.
